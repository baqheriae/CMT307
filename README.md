This repositary contains the python code and related datasets to the individual coursework of applied machine learning.
The code is used for sentiment analysis of reviews from IMDb in form of given datasets.
The contents of this repositary are:
1. Python code in jupyter notebook format (PART2code_c1963244.ipynb), and a .zip file containing another copy as a backup

2. Jupyter notebook


In order to run the code smoothly, please follow the follwoing instructions:
